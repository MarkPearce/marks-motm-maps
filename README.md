Mark's Mark of the Mantis Maps

![the latest version zip](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/MarkPearce/marks-motm-maps/latest/mmotmm.zip)

This is a remake of maps for the standalone Pathfinder 2E adventure, Mark of the Mantis.  Assets from Forgotten Adventures and Tom Cartos.

Includes scenes for the ground floor, roof and basement as well as a scene that uses the levels module to combine both floors in one scene.

There is a tile-image that can be used to show when a room changes, and overhead tiles for roofs. The scenes have lights and walls.
